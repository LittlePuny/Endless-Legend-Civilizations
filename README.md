# Changelog
### v0.8.1 Icons!
We now have unit icons! I am open to replace them later if something better suited shows up. Also note that there are also icons for missing units from Endless Legend. I've included because 1- units are still getting replaced here and there 2- It's useful to have them in case of a 3/4 UC expansion.
Other than units, there is also icons for most buildings, arcana pillars and new resources. Other missing icons will come later.

Sea Facilities
- Facilities with unique buildigns now correctly autobuild.
- Fixed some facility stats.

Ardent Mages:
- Added "Arcana Pillar" unique to their great improvements for filtering
- Strength bonus only applies to "Arcana Pillar" now. No more bonuses from enemy great improvements
- Industry and Dust pillars gets normal bonus from tech research now

Roving Clans:
- Added +10% gold when not at war. Make trade not war!

Cultists
- Fanatic is renamed to Preacher

Forgotten:
- Scout units now get "From the Shadows" promotion
- Myst removed
- Predatore back as Crossbowman replacement

Morgawr:
- Rapid Mutation should now allow units to heal.

### v0.8 Terrain-form
This update has some terrain stuff happening. This means both interesting changes and a ton more incompatibilities with other mods. Lack of tileset also means you should switch to Minimal tileset for now.
Also added a "New Nations Guide" to readme to briefly explain faction mechanics

Volcanic Terrains:
- 6 new volcanic terrains added for Kapaku volcanoform
- Grassland will become Ash Drifts which gives 1 Food, 1 Gold
- Plains, will become Basalt Plains which gives 1 Production, 1 Gold
- Tundra -will become Barren Soil which gives 1 Food, 1 Production
- Snow will become Lava Swirl which gives 1 Production, 1 Science
- Desert will become Badlands which gives 2 Gold
- Forest and Jungles will become Scorched Wildlands which gives 2 Production (unfortunately, due to implementation way, they become base terrain and not a cutable feature)
- Resources, improvements and features are edited to make them compatible with new terrain. Marshes burn up but Oasis and Flood Plains stay.

Ocean Fortresses/Facilities:
- Facilities are Natural Wonders that can generate in the water tiles next to coasts
- Each Facility provides at least 2 happiness and 1 culture. Units on them gain +25% defense
- 6 Facility that gives different tile yields
- 2 Facility that gives high happiness and a promotion to naval units next to them
- 5 Facility that gives a nation wide unique benefit (through free buildings)
- Each facility has weight of 10 for map generation

Natural Wonders:
- To balance the natural wonder distribution between land and water, 10 of the happiness anomalies from Endless Legend are now Natural Wonders
- Each wonder has weight of 10 for map generation but they don't generate in water maps

Wild Walkers:
- Replaced Jungle's +1 Food with +1 Production for real this time.

Morgawr:
- Fresh water bonus applies correctly now. Also first bonus is available from the start (to better help in maps with less water tiles)
- Land units can embark from the start (they can already enter the ocean)
- Vore base strength increased while defense bonus reduced

Kapaku
- National Unique now allows Volcanoform. Burn up the ground and turn the land into a volcanic paradise!
- Worker units can now spend 2 movement on a land tile to transform it into a volcanic terrain.
- Kapaku gets +1 food on volcanic terrain, allowing them to have land tile yields of at least 3 while rest has 2.
- Since Volcanoform is not limited to Kapaku borders, you can Volcanoform unsettled tiles or tiles you have access to with open borders. This means you can Volcanoform tiles of your allies or city states (which is helpful if they spawn near snow as Lava Swirl accepts Farm improvement)
- Old national unique is now for AI only as AI doesn't know how to volcanoform.

### v0.7.1
Mostly balance changes. Putting this out now before I mess with terrains for Kapaku Volcanoform stuff.

Echoes of Auriga: https://github.com/LittlePuny/Echoes-of-Auriga-for-UnCiv/tree/main
- Rename Spectator - From Dawn to Dusk Gary's Version - Theme.mp3 to From Dawn to Dusk Gary's Version - Ambient.mp3. Now it shouldn't cause weird audio bug.
- Added "unciv-mod-audio" tag

Wild Walkers:
- Replaced Jungle's +1 Food with +1 Production

Vaulters:
- Cities can now designate one "Holy Resource" which increases selected strategic resource quantity and its tile yields. 
- Science from Luxury and Bonus resource removed

Ardent Mages:
- Assigned new "Tall" personality with Tradition and Freedom priorty
- Only one free GP at discovering Philosophy

Drakken:
- City State military unit gifts start with +5 exp instead of +15 (correctly half of Siamese bonus)

Cultists:
- Wall of Faith removed
- Preacher added as Missionary replacement

Allayi:
- Assigned new "Tall" personality with Tradition and Freedom priorty

Morgawr:
- Harbor and Seaport tile bonuses also applies to Water tiles without resources
- Industry from fresh water delayed, with improvement later

Kapaku:

- Units ignore terrain costs when moving into any tile with Hills
- Manufactory provides food now
- Removed Geomancer
- Stone Sentinel now Swordsman replacement

Mykara:
- Relative bonuses are replaced with stronger Food bonus
- Food buildings now also give Production

### v0.7 One City to rule them all
This update revamps two "single city" nations

Liberty is blocked for both nations so no more free settler for them. (sidenote, mod can work with other extension mods changong stuff or even with some rulesets like Rekmod but there will be conflicts and problems) Players can probably get extra cities by snatching enemy settlers. Also both of them have their personality with high Warmongering so they shouldn't be a sitting duck whole game. 

Despite both of them being stacked with uniques, other AI's can beat them. Left unchecked, they will just build wonders and go for a cultural victory quiet easily. But their lack of control on puppets mean when forced to war, they can get stuck on producing military units and never get a chance to finish Utopia Project

Cultists have a focus on converting barbarian units and having a strong faith. Their puppets increase capital's GP generation and yields on Great Improvements. Mykara gets relative bonus to every stat. They also get some extra bonuses from engaging in diplomacy and their puppets don't have the standard Culture/Science penalty.

Cult of the Eternal End
- Single City related uniques and restrictions revamped
- National Unique redesigned with a focus of religion
- New AI personality to ensure they go Piety and go to wars
- High Seat of the Queen removed
- Walls of Faith added as Wall replacement
- Shrine of Whispers is no longer national unique. It gives faith and religion spread. It's capital bonuses reduced.

Mykara
- Single City related uniques and restrictions revamped
- National Unique redesigned with a focus of civilization diplomacy, and overall yields
- New AI personality to ensure they go Tradition and go to wars
- Kernel of Plentitude is no longer national unique.  It now gives yields to capital.
- Gorgon removed
- Ipotane added as Crossbowman replacement

### v0.6 Funding Science
Forgotten and their "Science Phobic" trait is done. Similar to Broken Lords, they don't generate science at all. Instead they can buy technologies with gold. Or more preferably, steal from other civilizations as they start with 1 Spy from the game start. Every source of Science (except for trade agreements and City States) is converted to Gold for them. This also means those science buildings can give obscene amount of gold due to their relative bonuses (so expect relevant changes later on)

Forgotten:
- Unique Ability revamped.
- Buyable technology buildings added
- Predatore removed
- Myst is now a scout replacement that is fast, invisible, has extra sight and ignores enemy borders. Gotta find that capital fast for your spy!
- Oxford University replaced with Caudata Sanctuary, which gives another spy and makes spies start with 1 extra level.

Broken Lords:
- Conditionals on uniques changed a bit

### v0.5 Shifting Uniques
Inspiration came while working on the Forgotten. This is the result.

Allayi now has a brand new "Shifting" mechanic. They start the game in Light Season, which gives them small growth, culture and gold bonus. Each turn, they also gain one Aurigan Pearl.
When they have at least 5 pearls, can enter a Dark Season which consumes their Aurigan Pearls every turn. During Dark Season, they lose the Light Season bonuses but gain production bonus, military strength and movement speed. They can prematurely end the Dark Season or keep it going until they run out of pearls. By using the Dark Season in a timely manner, you can move settlers faster or speed up wonder construction or buff your armies for war.

AI ignores the pearl mechanic and enters Dark Season when at war. This can make them kinda dangerous at warfare but declaring war also removes their culture and growth bonus, which they will benefit a lot for their culture victory.

Allayi:
- Unique Ability revamped. Now has two different sets of bonuses for Light and Dark Season
- Shift between seasons by spending Allayi exclusive resource, Aurigan Pearls
- Garth of Allayi now doubles the bonuses of Light Season in the city
- Skyfin gains extra sight (Its a giant flying manta ray thingie)

### v0.4.2
A generic bugfix

Necrophages:
- Cadaver units should properly upgrade only when you have the required tech now
- Feeding the Hive should only be available if you have enough Cadavers now

Forgotten:
- some preliminary work on their upcoming update. You should be able to play in Ancient and Classical era with little problem

### v0.4.1 unshackling the AI
After an epiphany, I realised I can use a bunch of conditionals so certain mechanics would impact human and AI players different. This ensures players will play with the intended mechanics while AI will play them more like a normal civ. This also opens up forced single city empires.

Broken Lords:
- AI no longer has the mechanics related to growth nullification. They no longer build/buy populations.
- Most gold bonuses are only for human players now

Necrophages:
- AI automatically uses Cadavers to buy a population in a random city.

### v0.4 Still Hungry
This update takes a look at the bug boys and gives them their "necromancy" mechanic.

Necrophages have a new unique resource, Cadavers, which is only available to them (seriously, other civs wont even know it exists). They gain one Cadaver for every unit they kill. They can use this Cadavers for two cool things. First is creating a population in a city just like in Endless Legend. Second is to buy Cadaver units, which is like having Battleborns in Endless Legend. They also get "Demanding Gods" action, which is a temporary building you can buy by sacrificing a population and negate unhappiness from population in that city for 10 turns. Now you can be the wild warmongerer from the getgo if you know how to feed.

Necrodrone is replaced with Proliferator, as a ranged unit synergizes with the Cadaver units better. As with the previous update AI has no idea how to use the Cadavers (I've seen him sit on 70+ cadavers on a winning game) but afaik it doesn't kill all its cities with Demanding Gods too so faction uniques are player oriented with this one too.

- We now have a Preview image!
  
Necrophages:
- New unique resource called Cadavers, only available and visible for Necrophages
- Gain Cadavers by killing military units
- Spend 4 Cadavers to buy warrior line of units. Cadaver units have half maintenance cost and upgrade for free.
- Spend 4 Cadavers to create a population in a city - Feed the Hive
- Can Sacrifice a population to negate population unhappiness of a city for 10 turns - Demanding Gods
- Generic strength bonus at war is removed.
- Proliferate promotion is removed from ranged units
- All military units start with Recycler promotion, which gives some flanking bonus (and make the Cadaver mechanic possible)
- Feeding Pits also has Culture cost reduction natural border growth now.
- Necrodrones removed.
- Made Proliferators a replacement for Composite Bowman.
  
Vaulters:
- Dawn Officer rejects being French and becoems Vaulter instead.


### v0.3 "Broken" Lords
Main change in this version is the implementation of Broken Lords "buy your population" mechanic. 

Broken Lords no longer gain any food at all. They won't have any natural growth or starvation. Instead, every source of food (execpt for maritime city-states) have been turned into gold with nation unique. They have buildings that gives 1 pop to the city they are build. These buildings have increasing cost based on existing population of the city and autodelete themself so any source of pop loss (nukes or conquered city) is taken into account.

Two issues with the mechanic: first is that AI in no way knows what to do so it will sit on 1 population cities and have abyssmal yields all around. Second is that putting an extra set of buildings to build in every city slows down your normal production queues, which is crucial in early game. To combat that a bit, first 10 population costs are lower than they would normally be. Expect balancing on that later on, with increased costs for later populations.

Broken Lords:
- Unique Ability replaced.
- Buildable population mechanic added
- Altar of Channeling removed (just more gold is boring)
- Stalwarts added as Spearman replacement

### v0.2.1
Some prefered victory types are changed

Necrophage:
- Removed food buff/debuff from Necrophage as they didn't add a lot to their gameplay.
- Increased Necrophage at war bonus to 15%.
- Removed annexed city restriction form Feeding Pits.
- Made Necrodrone a replacement for Pikemen instead of Scout.
  
Ardent Mages:
- Gains 3 great persons when entering different eras now.
- 10% strength within 2 tiles of great improvement added.
- Added Ateshi Zealot as Canon replacement.
- Nonmechanical changes to reduce pillar related stuff showing up on nation screen.
  
Roving Clans:
- Setseke slightly cheaper and gives 1 pop to random city.
  
Kapaku:
- Added Geomancer as Gatling Gun replacement.
