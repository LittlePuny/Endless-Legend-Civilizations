### v0.4 Still Hungry
This update takes a look at the bug boys and gives them their "necromancy" mechanic.

Necrophages have a new unique resource, Cadavers, which is only available to them (seriously, other civs wont even know it exists). They gain one Cadaver for evety unit they kill. They can use this Cadavers for two cool things. First is creating a population in a city just like in Endless Legend. Second is to buy Cadaver units, which is like having Battleborns in Endless Legend. They also get "Demanding Gods" action, which is a temporary building you can buy by sacrificing a population and negate unhappiness from population in that city for 10 turns. Now you can be the wild warmongerer from the getgo if you know how to feed.

Necrodrone is replaced with Proliferator, as a ranged unit synergizes with the Cadaver units better. As with the previous update AI has no idea how to use the Cadavers (I've seen him sit on 70+ cadavers on a winning game) but afaik it doesn't kill all its cities with Demanding Gods too so faction uniques are player oriented with this one too.

- We now have a Preview image!
Necrophages:
- New unique resource called Cadavers, only available and visible for Necrophages
- Gain Cadavers by killing military units
- Spend 4 Cadavers to buy warrior line of units. Cadaver units have half maintenance cost and upgrade for free.
- Spend 4 Cadavers to create a population in a city - Feed the Hive
- Can Sacrifice a population to negate population unhappiness of a city for 10 turns - Demanding Gods
- Generic strength bonus at war is removed.
- Proliferate promotion is removed from ranged units
- All military units start with Recycler promotion, which gives some flanking bonus (and make the Cadaver mechanic possible)
- Feeding Pits also has Culture cost reduction natural border growth now.
- Necrodrones removed.
- Made Proliferators a replacement for Composite Bowman.
Vaulters:
- Dawn Officer rejects being French and becoems Vaulter instead.


### v0.3 "Broken" Lords
Main change in this version is the implementation of Broken Lords "buy your pops=ulation" mechanic. 

Broken Lords no longer gain any food at all. They won't have any natural growth or starvation. Instead, every source of food (execpt for maritime city-states) have been turned into gold with nation unique. They have buildings that gives 1 pop to the city they are build. These buildings have increasing cost based on existing population of the city and autodelete themself so any source of pop loss (nukes or conquered city) is taken into account.

Two issues with the mechanic: first is that AI in no way knows what to do so it will sit on 1 population cities and have abyssmal yields all around. Second is that putting an extra set of buildings to build in every city slows down your normal production queues, which is crucial in early game. To combat that a bit, first 10 population costs are lower than they would normally be. Expect balancing on that later on, with increased costs for later populations.

Broken Lords:
- Unique Ability replaced.
- Buildable population mechanic added
- Altar of Channeling removed (just more gold is boring)
- Stalwarts added as Spearman replacement

Ardent Mages:
