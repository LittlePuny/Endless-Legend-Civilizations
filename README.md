### v0.3 "Broken" Lords
Main change in this version is the implementation of Broken Lords "buy your pops=ulation" mechanic. 

Broken Lords no longer gain any food at all. They won't have any natural growth or starvation. Instead, every source of food (execpt for maritime city-states) have been turned into gold with nation unique. They have buildings that gives 1 pop to the city they are build. These buildings have increasing cost based on existing population of the city and autodelete themself so any source of pop loss (nukes or conquered city) is taken into account.

Two issues with the mechanic: first is that AI in no way knows what to do so it will sit on 1 population cities and have abyssmal yields all around. Second is that putting an extra set of buildings to build in every city slows down your normal production queues, which is crucial in early game. To combat that a bit, first 10 population costs are lower than they would normally be. Expect balancing on that later on, with increased costs for later populations.

- Broken Lords:
- Unique Ability replaced.
- Buildable population mechanic added
- Altar of Channeling removed (just more gold is boring)
- Stalwarts added as Spearman replacement
