Their gift was to shape rocks and trees into great buildings; cities rose as green towers in the deep woods. This act, called The Sharing, let an elf experience the wild, untamed energy of their totem animal. Elves who Shared often, however risked having the spirit of the beast burst out like a violent flame and take control during moments of stress. In spite of that, some sought increasingly savage beasts in order to experience Sharings of greater intensity."
		"startIntroPart2": "With individuals embracing the savagery of the animals and vanishing forever into the woods, the nation had to choose between the wild spirits of nature and the civilization of their towers. Troubled but determined, they forswore the Sharing, renamed themselves the Wild Walkers, and set out to build their towers away from their dark past. Only time will tell if the Sharing still has its hold on their souls."

		"startIntroPart1": "The Mykara are a race of sentient plant matter and fungi, a single organism spanning thousands of semi-autonomous agents and time immemorial, ever adapting to survive and thrive. They spread all over Auriga as a massive underground root system, sprouting on the edges of the map, clinging to the regions other factions leave unattended."
		"startIntroPart2": "The Mykara are a single, vast organism that has spread beneath the surface of Auriga, covering most of the planet. Yet all roots lead to home, their capital serving as a hub for their physical spread and their consciousness. Consequently, the Mykara are focused on a single city and have to exert their control over the world by different means, much like the Cultists of the Eternal End. Unlike their more religious rivals, who have to pacify villages and convert them with Influence, the Mykara do not have to be present near the areas they want to claim. As long as you have had vision on a point of interest before and it is located in a neutral region, you can begin growing a Fungal Bloom on it."
